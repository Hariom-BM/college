Daily Motivational Thought for Slack üöÄ
This is a small Node.js project that generates a new and inspiring motivational thought every morning and sends it to your Slack channel. It uses the Google Gemini API to generate the thoughts, making each message unique.

üí° Why was this built?
This project is an excellent practice for a junior developer to learn about:

How to work with APIs.

Server-side scripting in Node.js.

Integrating with external applications using Slack Webhooks.

Understanding automation and scheduling (e.g., Cron Jobs).

‚öôÔ∏è Setup and Installation
To run this project, you need to follow a few simple steps.

1. Get the Slack Webhook URL
Go to the Slack API Website.

Create a new Slack app.

In your app's dashboard, enable Incoming Webhooks.

Click on "Add New Webhook to Workspace" and choose the channel where you want to send the messages.

Copy the Webhook URL.

2. Get the Google Generative AI API Key
You will need an API key if you are running this project on your local computer.

Go to the Google Cloud Console.

Create a new project (or select an existing one).

Enable the "Generative Language API".

In the "Credentials" section, create a new API key.

3. Run the Project
Create the project file (e.g., motivator.js).

In your terminal, run this command to install the Axios library:

npm install axios

In your motivator.js file, update the slackWebhookUrl and API_KEY:

const slackWebhookUrl = "Your Slack Webhook URL";
const API_KEY = "Your Google API Key"; // Only for local use

Run the script:

node motivator.js

üìÖ How to Schedule the Script
To have the script run automatically every morning, you can use your operating system's scheduling tool.

On Linux/macOS: Cron Job
In the terminal, run crontab -e and add this line (adjust your path accordingly):

0 10 * * * /usr/bin/node /path/to/your/script/motivator.js

On Windows: Task Scheduler
Use the Task Scheduler to create a new task that runs the node motivator.js command every morning at 10:00 AM.
